# Commons Validation

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/finacore/commons-validation.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/finacore/commons-validation)

This module is part of __FINACORE__ software and has as objective to facilitate and standardise the validation process throughout the software execution time line. 

As all other products and modules of __FINACORE__ project, this package has a strong code documentations that generates the fullfil tutorial disponible at [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/finacore/commons-validation) reference page, that is enough for their usage.

This lib use [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) combined with [Horusec](https://horusec.io/) to understand the code quality and security, blocking the pull request in any vulnerability incidence.

As well as security, performance is a fundamental factor of all __FINACORE__ software, package or modules. This way this package use the __benchmark regression__ to ensure that no performance gaps ocours.

The result of benchmark regression is disponible at: [Performance Regeression](https://finacore.github.io/commons-validation/dev/bench/)
